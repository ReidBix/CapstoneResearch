A lot of the security of the net relies on the fact that these digital signatures are truly secure and won’t be ‘easily’ broken. With the coming potential of quantum computers, there is a growing need for quantum secure algorithms and signatures alike. Many quantum-resistant encryption algorithms have been proposed, but most have not been designed to support signatures. In this post, I am going to look into the applications of some quantum signatures and their usefulness in current technologies.\r\n\r\n# Lattice Signatures\r\nI'm first going to look at Lattice-Based cryptography, based off of the fact that it is often the most cited and used form of post-quantum cryptography. In future posts, we'll get more into how lattice cryptography works, but for now we will describe some current signature schemes.\r\n\r\n## Ring-LWE Signatures\r\n### (http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/537.pdf)\r\nRing Learning with Error is based on the arithmetic of polynomials with coefficients from a finite field. In 2011, Lyubashevsky came up with the application of the Ring-LWE structure for signatures based off of the worst-case hardness of the Shortest Independent Vectors Problem (SIVP) in general lattices. In his paper, he looks at the Small Integer Solution (SIS) problem and its application to a signature scheme based off of its provable hardness. The requirements behind the signature are a secret key of m x k matrix of S random integers and a signer must pick an m-dimensional vector y from a distribution D which then is used to compute c such that ( c = H(Ay,m) ) which is then used to compute z such that ( z = Sc+y ). The signature that the signer will output is (z,c), put there is a probability that a signature will not be outputted, at which point the signer will run the algorithm until a signature is outputted. The signature length and key size can change based off of the signers choosing, but there are certain security implications if those values are too small. Later in the paper, applications of SIS and LWE define a Ring Variant of a SIS signature which is provably improved from the previous two signature schemes. Specifically, the scheme defines a secret key s1,…, sγ where every coefficient of si is chosen uniformly and independently from a predefined range. A public key is created (a1,…, aγ, t) where each ai is uniformly random and t is defined as the sum of each multiple of ai and si. A message is signed, which can be verified easily with the public key. This scheme is based on the provable hardness of the ring variant of the SIS problem. This final ring variant is the Ring-LWE Signature provided by Lyubashevsky.\r\n\r\n## GGH Signatures\r\n### (http://eprint.iacr.org/1996/016.ps)\r\nThe Goldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi signature scheme was published in 1997 and is based on the Closest Vector Problem (CVP) which is also a lattice based problem. Signers show their message using a lattice, which the verifier then verifies on the different lattice point sufficiently close to the previously designated message point of the same lattice. The GGH signature scheme is more based on an encryption algorithm but the application to signatures is perfectly viable, while difficult.\r\n\r\n## NTRUSign\r\n### (http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1363/WorkingGroup/presentations/NTRUSign-2005-08.ppt)\r\nNTRUSign is based on the GGH signature scheme which was put into publication in 2003, but was revised with parameter recommendations in 2005. This signature scheme uses 2 short polynomials in a ring which are then used to place the intended message in a 2N-dimensional space. One of the problems presented with NTRUSign is the fact that a transcript of signatures can leak information about the private key. After the creators reformed their parameter recommendations in 2005, they suggested that 20^30 signatures were needed to possibly find the private key, however a recent 2012 analysis of NTRUSign proved that they only needed about a couple thousand signatures to provably find the private key.\r\n\r\n## BLISS\r\n### (http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/383.pdf)\r\nFinally, and most importantly, in 2013 the BLISS protocol was introduced as a solution to all the previously broken signature schemes introduced. BLISS is very similar to Ring-LWE in structure, but has some notable changes which allow for it to (so far) not give away the secret key over consistent usage. The signature and verification algorithm are shown below:\r\n![](http://imgur.com/rVMwR7l)\r\n\r\nHowever, there were optimizations introduced later in the publication, specifically defining the BLISS signature scheme:\r\n![](http://imgur.com/Ld96OYB)\r\n\r\nUsing the BLISS signature scheme for future signatures look to prove quite useful, however compared to current schemes there are noticeable drawbacks:\r\n![](http://imgur.com/34MHKtO)\r\n\r\nThe BLISS scheme noticeably takes more space than RSA or ECDSA, but this is the most applicable and secure implementation of lattice-based cryptography so far. \r\n\r\n# Multivariate Signatures\r\nThis type of cryptography is based off of multivariate polynomials over a finite field. One of the ‘benefits’ of multivariate cryptography is the fact that it is extremely useful in the application of signatures, but all encryption schemes using multivariate cryptography have failed. In this post, I intend on going strictly into the viability of Lattice Signatures, but I am adding the types of signature schemes I may look at in the future.\r\n\r\n## CyclicRainbow\r\n### (https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/424.pdf)\r\n\r\n## MI-T-HFE\r\n### (https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/890.pdf)\r\n\r\n## GUI\r\n### (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-2015/papers/session1-ding-paper.pdf)\r\n\r\n# Hash-Based Signatures\r\nHash signatures have been around since around 1970 ever since Ralph Merkle came up with the idea of the Merkle Trees as an alternative to RSA and DSA. The interesting thing about hash signatures are that the use of hashing is already widely used, but has been proven to be quantum resistant unlike some of the other current encryption methods. This means that using hash-based signatures could prove easier to implement into future technologies simply because people are more used to them. Similarly to the previous section, I will go into this more on future posts.\r\n\r\n## Merkle\r\n### (https://www.emsec.rub.de/media/crypto/attachments/files/2011/04/becker_1.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Lamport\r\n### (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/documents/preneel_nist_v2.pdf)\r\n\r\n# Code-Based Signatures\r\nCode-Based encryption schemes are based on the general hardness of decoding a general linear code. McEliece and Niederreiter encryption algorithms were discovered in the late 20th century, but the problem with code-based signatures is there will be very large key sizes required. Because of this problem, the code-based cryptography has only seen potential application to encryption schemes and not as much into signature schemes.\r\n\r\n## Code-based Signatures\r\n### (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.4265v1.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Stern's Scheme\r\n### (https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/163.pdf)\r\n\r\n# Post-Quantum Signatures Conclusion\r\nThere exist quite a number of signature schemes that have proven to be quantum resistant. In terms of applications, the most likely forms we may use will be Lattice-Based or Multivariate signature schemes. However, the biggest problem that we will see in the implementation of quantum resistant signatures are the large key sizes in comparison to current key sizes. This means that many protocols will need to be changed to work with the new signature schemes, as introduced in the suggestion of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE). Another problem that remains to be solved is the fact that many of these quantum resistant algorithms are not guaranteed to be quantum resistant. To better explain, the only reason why some algorithms like RSA and ECDSA are provably broken by quantum computing is because of the creation of Shor’s Algorithm which shows that quantum will break the foundation of prime factorization. The current post-quantum algorithms rely on both a NP-Hard problem as well as not having a quantum algorithm that breaks that hardness. While there currently do not exist any solutions to Lattice-Based or Multivariate problems with quantum computing, that does not mean that there will not exist such algorithms in the future. The security of all these quantum-resistant schemes are based on the assumption that there will not be an algorithm found to break the schemes. Regardless of this, striving to improve the security of the internet and technology is paramount. These quantum algorithms hold just as much security as current cryptographic algorithms do today, because they are based on NP-Hard problems that have no solutions capable of breaking the security of the algorithms.\r\n",
