In this blog I will be looking into various topics including post-quantum signatures, effects of quantum computing on Bitcoin, benefits of switching to post-quantum algorithms, how to integrate a backwards compatible post-quantum algorithm into the Bitcoin protocol, and whatever other topics come up.\r\n\r\n### Members\r\nReid Bixler (Researcher)\r\n\r\nDavid Evans (Technical Thesis Advisor)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you have any questions or would like to contact us about my research, feel free to email either me or my technical advisor: {rmb3yz, evans}@virginia.edu",
